To find the public IP of a given instance on the EC2 console, first enter the Instance ID of the specified instance into the search box at the top of the screen. After the search finishes, navigate to the "Public DNS" column. The contents of that file describe the public IP for the given instance.

If you need to find the actual IP of the instance, look instead for the "Public IP" column in the row that corresponds to your specified instance.
